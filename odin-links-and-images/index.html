<p>Things about links</p>

<a>I'm an anchor but I'm no use on my own</a>
<br />
<!--An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element 
    and always goes in the elementâ€™s opening tag. 
    An attribute is usually made up of two parts: a name, and a value; 
    however, not all attributes require a value-->

<h2>Noopener and noreferrer</h2>

<p>
    The link above contains the <strong>rel</strong> attribute set to the values <em>"noopener noreferrer"</em>, 
    very useful for security reasons.
</p>
<h2>Relative and absolute links</h2>
<p>We know about absolute and relative links already, but it can be useful to remenber about the <strong>dot</strong> before relative links</p>
<p>For example, we may want to write <em>./somefolder/somepage.html</em> to specify that we want to start from the same directory as the page with the link</p>


<h2>The image tag</h2>
