<!--  note: html tags can be structured in several ways

Some are made with the opening and closing tag and some stuff inbetween <sometag>some thing</sometag>, for example
the <em>words</em>.
Some are a mixture, they require at least a parameter and something inbetween the opening and closing tags in order to do something useful, like for example the anchor hyperlink <a href="someurl">text of the link</a>
Some are a single pair of parentesis (meaning they only have an opening tag) with keyword and attribute(s) inside, for example <meta charset="somecharset"> 
and also the img tag is the same: <img src=".path/to/image.png" alt="This is a png picture">. They are called "self closing"
Some have special beginning character, like the !DOCTYPE or this comment itself.
And there is <br /> and maybe more.
The img tag can also have a closing slash

<body>

<h1>Fake article of the fake blog, and this is header 1</h1>
    <p>This is the fake paragraph of the fake blog. </p>
    <p>To get to a new line, I need to close the tag and open a new one </p>
    <h2>This is header two, but is this the right place for it? </h2>
    <p>In this paragraph, let's see how the <strong>strong tag </strong>looks. </p>
    <p>In this one, let's see the <em>emphasis tag.</em> </p>
<h2>Entities</h2>
<p>To represent <strong>reserved characters</strong> in the text of an html page, we have to use <strong>entities.</strong></p>
If you look at the source code for the following list, you will see that the space and the brackets are creating by some weird encoding.
<p>
<ul>
<li>this bracket &lt;</li>
<li>this other bracket &gt;</li>
<li>and &nbsp;the&nbsp;spaces&nbsp;&nbsp;between&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these&nbsp;r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words</li>
<li>the "And" symbol &amp;</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
 They all start with the symbol <strong>"And"</strong> followed by a<strong> semicolon </strong> at the end. Inbetween these two is the entity code.
