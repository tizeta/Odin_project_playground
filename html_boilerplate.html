<!--  note: html elements can be structured in several ways

Some are made with the opening and closing tag and some stuff inbetween <sometag>some thing</sometag>, for example
the <em>words</em>
Some are a mixture, like the anchor hyperlink <a href="someurl">text of the link</a>
Some are a single pair of parentesis with keyword and value inside, for example <meta charset="somecharset"> 
and also the img tag is the same: <img src=".path/to/image.png" alt="This is a png picture">. They are called "self closing"
Some have special beginning character, like the !DOCTYPE or this comment itself
And there is <br /> and maybe more.
