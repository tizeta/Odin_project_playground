<!--  note: tags can be structured in several ways

Some are made with the opening and closing tag <sometag>some thing</sometag>
Some are a single pair of parentesis with keyword and value inside the tag, for example <meta >
Some have special beginning character, like the !DOCTYPE or this comment itself
Some are a mixture, like the anchor hyperlink <a href="someurl">text of the link</a>
And there is <br /> and maybe more.
